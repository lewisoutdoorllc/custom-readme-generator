  ## Description
  This weather dashboard was made to allow the user to obtain the current weather for a city of there choice and provide a 5 day future forcast so they can plan there travel. It provides the user the ability to see current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index; the uv index is also indicated by green, yellow, and red depending on severity. The future 5 day forcast provides the user with the dates, weather conditions, temperatures, and humidity. Finally the search history of the user is logged and displayed on the right side in a list that is populated based on the users searches.
